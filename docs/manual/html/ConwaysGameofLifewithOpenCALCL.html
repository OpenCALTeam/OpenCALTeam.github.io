<H2 id="conways-game-of-life-with-opencal-cl"><A NAME="8_5">Conwayâ€™s
 Game of Life with OpenCAL-CL</A></H2>
<P>As already reported in [sec:cal_life], to introduce how to develop a
 Cellular Automata model with OpenCAL-CL we can start by implementing
 Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and specifically its host application part. In
 order to use OpenCAL-CL, some header files are included (lines 3-8)
 and, in particular, the OpenCAL library and the OpenCAL-CL library. The
 OpenCAL library inclusion inside the host application is necessary to
 define the CA object (line 46) and the related substates (line 49). The
 cal2DIO.h header file (line 4) provides some basic input/output
 functions for reading/writing substates from/to file. To run the
 application with OpenCAL-CL, all the necessary objects have to be
 declared (line 27-31): specifically, the <CODE>CALOpenCL</CODE>
 structure (line 27), the <CODE>CALCLcontext</CODE>, the <CODE>
CALCLdevice</CODE>, the <CODE>CALCLprogram</CODE> and the <CODE>
CALCLToolkit2D</CODE>. To create and initialize these variables we need
 to call the function <CODE>calclCreateCALOpenCL</CODE> that creates the
 CALOpenCL structure, the functions <CODE>calclInitializePlatforms</CODE>
 and <CODE>calclInitializeDevices</CODE> that initialize all the
 platforms and devices on the available machine and the <CODE>
calclGetDevice()</CODE> function, which will return the device where
 elementary process are computed by choosing the <CODE>platformNum</CODE>
 and <CODE>deviceNum</CODE> integers(line 24-25). Moreover, two
 important functions are here considered: <CODE>calclcreateContext</CODE>
 and <CODE>calclLoadProgramLib2D</CODE>. The first returns the context
 [sec:openclstructure], while the second builds all kernels inside the
 path specified by <CODE>kernelSrc</CODE>(line 15) including the files
 specified by <CODE>kernelInc</CODE>(line 16), and returns a program
 containing all the compiled kernels.</P>
<P>The definition and declaration of the model (line 46) has the same
 code that we discussed in [sec:cal_life], and includes all the
 information to create the model, to create and initialize substates
 (line 49-52) and to set a initial configuration (line 55-59).</P>
<P>Although the OpenCAL-CL library uses the same functions of the
 OpenCAL library to create the model and the substates, the execution of
 the elementary processes is quite different. As known, our elementary
 processes are implemented on GPU side through kernels, so we need to
 manage the transfer of memory between host and device sides and to
 decide which and when run the kernels. In a classical OpenCL
 application, itâ€™s not trivial to handle all these issues. For this
 reason, in OpenCAL-CL we decided to introduce an intermediate object (<CODE>
CALCLToolkit</CODE>) that hides to the user the memory management and
 handles the compiled chosen kernels. The user must only initialize the <CODE>
CALCLToolkit</CODE> structure(line 62) and choose which kernel he/she
 wants to execute by the function <CODE>calclGetKernelFromProgram</CODE>
 specifying the program and kernel names. Once kernels are chosen to be
 executed, the user must only call the function <CODE>
calclAddElementaryProcessKernel2D</CODE> (line 71) that adds the
 specific kernel elementary process inside the <CODE>CALCLToolkit</CODE>
 structure. Finally, to run the simulation the user must call the
 function <CODE>calclRun2D</CODE> specifying the initial and final step.</P>
<P>Below is reported the device side code of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. In
 this application, we have only one elementary process, defined as a
 kernel called <CODE>life_transition_function</CODE>.
<BR> The OpenCAL-CL library will launch exactly a number of threads
 equal to the entire cellular space, structured like a matrix. In this
 way, every cell can perform in parallel its own computation. To access
 to the indexes of the cell the user must call the function <CODE>getRow</CODE>
 and <CODE>getCol</CODE> line(14-15). Furthermore, the user can use the
 function <CODE>get_columns</CODE> and <CODE>get_rows</CODE> (line
 17-18) to retrieve the dimensions of the cellular space. In the
 specific case of the Game of Life, we used the <CODE>calGet2Di</CODE>
 function to get the central cellâ€™s value of the sub- state Q
 (remember that the central cell is identified by the coordinates (i,
 j)), the <CODE>calGetX2Di</CODE> function to retrieve the value of the
 n-th neighbourâ€™s substate Q, and the <CODE>calSet2Di</CODE> function
 to update the value of the substate Q for the central cell.</P>

<LI id="fn8">
<P>This characteristic is colled<EM> implicit parallelism</EM> and is
 obtained in OpenCAL by considering two different working planes for
 each registered substate, namely<EM> current</EM> and<EM> next</EM>
 working planes. However, behind the scene, cells are updated
 sequentially, being OpenCAL a serial software. The<EM> current</EM>
 working plane is used to read current values for the cells, while the<EM>
 next</EM> working plane is used to write updated values. The<EM>
 implicit parallelism</EM> is also used in the parallel versions of
 OpenCAL, with the difference that more than one cell can be processed
 and updated concurrently by exploiting mre than one processing unit.<A href="#fnref8">
&acirc;†&copy;</A></P>
</LI>
<LI id="fn9">
<P>On the serial version of OpenCAL, implicit parallelism is obtained by
 exploiting the two different computing planes built into OpenCALâ€™s
 substates. The first one, that we will call<EM> current</EM>, is used
 to read substatesâ€™s values for the central cell and its neighbours,
 while the second, that we will call<EM> next</EM>, is used to update
 the new state for the central cell. When all the cells have been
 processed and the new state values updated, computing planes are
 switched, i.e. the<EM> next</EM> plane is assumed as<EM> current</EM>
 and the<EM> current</EM> as<EM> next</EM>, and the process is
 reiterated. In this manner, the<EM> current</EM> computing plane is not<EM>
 corrupted</EM> during a computational step, being new values written to
 the<EM> next</EM> plane. Note that, even in the case more processing
 units are used to compute the next CA state and more cells are updated
 simltaneously, which is the case of OpenCAL-OMP and OpenCAL-CL, the two
 computing planes are manteined.<A href="#fnref9">&acirc;†&copy;</A></P>

<P>Remember that, by default, substates are updated after the

</LI>
<LI id="fn11">
<P>This is due to the fact that a substatesâ€™ update is performed after
 the first elementary process has been applied to all the (active) cells
 of the cellular space. This behaviour is set by menas of the <CODE>
CAL_UPDATE_IMPLICIT</CODE> parameter used in the definition of the
 simulation object at line 132 of Listing [lst:cal_sciddicaT-unsafe].<A href="#fnref11">

<P>Actually, only

 \(Q.h\) can be update by the transition function, since

 \(Q.z\) is a single-lyered substate.<A href="#fnref12">&acirc;†&copy;</A></P>
</LI>
<LI id="fn13">
<P>Note that active cells are updated first otherwise the subsequent
 substate update could neglect some cells that have become active during
 the current step. For instance, inactive cells can receive a flow and
 become active at he current step of computation. If the set of active
 cells is not updated before any other substates, those new cells will
 still be considered inactive during the current step and their value
 will not be updated, by losing debris flow mass.<A href="#fnref13">&acirc;†&copy;</A>
