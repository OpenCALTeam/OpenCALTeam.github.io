<P>Cellular Automata (CA) represent a parallel computing methodology for
 modelling complex systems. Well known examples of applications include
 the simulation of natural phenomena such as lava and debris flows,
 forest fires, agent based social processes such as pedestrian
 evacuation and highway traffic problems, besides many others (e.g.,
 theoretical studies).</P>
<P>Many Cellular Automata software environments and libraries exist.
 However, when non-trivial modelling is needed, only non-open source
 software are generally available. This is particularly true for
 eXtended Cellular Automata (XCA), adopted for simulating phenomena at a
 macroscopic point of view, for which only a significant example of non
 free software exists, namely the CAMELot Cellular Automata Simulation
 Environment.</P>
<P>In order to fill this deficiency in the world of free software, the <CODE>
OpenCAL</CODE> C Library has been developed. Similarly to CAMELot, it
 allows for a simple and concise definition of both the transition
 function and the other characteristics of the cellular automaton
 definition. Moreover, it allows for both sequential and parallel
 execution, both on CPUs and GPUs (thanks to the adoption of the OpenMP
 and OpenCL APIs, respectively), hiding most parallel implementation
 issues to the user.</P>
<P>The library has been tested on both CPUs anf GPUs by considering
 different Cellular Automata, including the well known Conway’s Game
 of Life and the SciddicaT XCA debris flows simulation model. Results
 have demonstrated the goodness the library both in terms of usability
 and performance.</P>
<P>In the present release 1.0 of the library, 2D and 3D cellular
 automata can be defined<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><SUP>
1</SUP></A>. The library also offers diverse facilities (e.g. it
 provides many pre-defined cell’s neighborhoods), allows to explicate
 the simulation main cycle and provides a built in optimization
 algorithm to speed up your simulation. Moreover, OpenCAL offers you a
 built in interactive 2D/3D visualization system you can use to
 graphically represent step by step your simulation based. The
 visualization system was developed in OpenGL Compatibility Profile,
 thus is able to run everywhere, also on old workstations.</P>
<P>The present manual reports the main usage of the <CODE>OpenCAL</CODE>
 library related to the sequential, OpenMP and OpenCL versions, the
 library installation procedure, besides diverse examples of
 application. In particular, Chapter [ch:installation] deals with
 OpenCAL download and installation, while Chapter [ch:CA] introduce you
 to the CA and XCA computational paradigms. If you already know theese
 topics, you can skip this Chapter. Chapter [ch:opencal] is about serial
 CA and XCA development with OpenCAL, and introduce the different
 library features by examples. Chapter [ch:opencal-omp] is about the
 OpenMP-based parallel version of OpenCAL and also introduces the
 library by examples. Chapter [ch:opencal-cl] briefly introduces you to
 General Purpose GPU programmin with OpenCL and then presents you the
 OpenCL-based version of OpenCAL, still by examples. OpenCAL-GL, whihch
 is the name that identifies the OpenGL visualization system built into
 OpenCAL, is introduced at the end of each of the above Chapters,
 together with computational performaces of some of the implemented CA.
 Eventually, Chapter [ch:utility] ends this user guide by presenting you
 some usefull library features that weren’t presented previously, like
 reduction functions.</P>
