<H2 id="sec:cal_life"><A NAME="6_1">Conway’s Game of Life</A></H2>
<P>In order to introduce you to Cellular Automata development with
 OpenCAL, we start this section by implementing the Conway’s Game of
 Life. It represents one of the most simple, yet powerful examples of
 Cellular Automata, devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</P>
<P>The Game of Life can be thought as an infinite two-dimensional
 orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two
 possible states,<EM> dead</EM> or<EM> alive</EM>. Every cell interacts
 with the eight adjacent neighbors <A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">
<SUP>7</SUP></A> belonging to the Moore neighborhood. At each time step,
 one of the following transitions occur:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>Any live cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies, as if by
 loneliness.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Any live cell with more than three alive neighbors dies, as if by
 overcrowding.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Any live cell with two or three alive neighbors lives, unchanged, to
 the next generation.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>The initial configuration of the system specifies the state (dead or
 alive) of each cell into the cellular space. The evolution of the
 system is thus obtained by applying the above rules (which define the
 cell’s transition function) simultaneously to every cell in the
 cellular space, so that each new configuration is function of the one
 at the previous step. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to
 create further generations. For more details on the Game of Life,
 please check Wikipedia at the URL <A class="uri" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">

<P>The program below shows a simple Game of Life sequential
 implementation in C with OpenCAL. As you can see, even if Listing
 [lst:cal_life] is very short, it completely defines the Conway’s Game
 of Life CA and performs a simulation (actually, only one computational
 step in this example).</P>
<P>In order to use OpenCAL, you need to include some header files (lines
 3-5). Specifically, <CODE>cal2D.h</CODE> (line 3) allows you to define
 the CA object (line 9) and the related substate (line 10), while <CODE>
cal2DRun.h</CODE> (line 5) allows you to define a CA simulation object
 (line 11), needed to run the CA model. The <CODE>cal2DIO.h</CODE>
 header file (line 4) provides you some basic input/output functions for
 reading/writing substates from/to file.</P>
<P>While statements at lines 9-11 just declare the required objects,
 they are defined later in the <CODE>main</CODE> function. In
 particular, the life CA object is defined at line 29 by the <CODE>
calCADef2D()</CODE> function. The first 2 parameters define the CA
 dimensions (the number of rows and columns, respectively), while the
 third parameter defines the neighbourhood pattern. Here, the predefined
 Moore neighborhood is selected (cf. Figure [fig:LifeNeighborhood]),
 among those provided by OpenCAL. See Listings [lst:CALNeighborhood2D]
 and [lst:CALNeighborhood3D] for a list of OpenCAL’s predefined 2D and
 3D neighborhoods, respectively. Custom neighborhoods can also be
 defined by means of the <CODE>calAddNeighbor2D()</CODE> function. In
 both cases, indices are assigned progressively, starting from 0, each
 time a new cell is added to the neighborhood.</P>
<P>The fourth parameter specifies the boundary conditions. In this case,
 the CA cellular space is considered as a torus, with cyclic conditions
 at boundaries. The last parameter allows you to specify if your model
 has to use the so called<EM> active cells optimization</EM>, that is
 able to restrict the computation to only<EM> non-stationary cells</EM>.
 In this case, no optimization is considered.</P>
<PRE> <CODE> struct CALModel2D* calCADef2D (
    int rows,
    int columns,
    enum CALNeighborhood2D CAL_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D,
    enum CALSpaceBoundaryCondition CAL_TOROIDALITY,
    enum CALOptimization CAL_OPTIMIZATION
  )</CODE></PRE>
<P>The complete definition of <CODE>calCADef2D()</CODE> is provided in
 Listing [lst:calCADef2D], here reported together with few other OpenCAL
 key functions and data types. In particular, the <CODE>
CALNeighborhood2D</CODE> enum type (Listing [lst:CALNeighborhood2D])
 allows you to select one of the square or hexagonal predefined
 neighbourhoods, or a custom neighbourhood, whose pattern must be
 defined in the application. In particular, <CODE>
CAL_VON_NEUMANN_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D</CODE> corresponds to the von Neumann
 neighbouring pattern, <CODE>CAL_MOORE_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D</CODE> to the
 Moore neighbouring pattern, <CODE>CAL_HEXAGONAL_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D</CODE>
 to the hexagonal neighbouring pattern, and <CODE>
CAL_HEXAGONAL_NEIGHBORHOOD_ALT_2D</CODE> to the alternative hexagonal
 neighbouring pattern (cf. Figure [fig:2Dneighborhood], Section
 [sec:CAInformaDef]). As regards 3D neighbourhoods patterns, they are
 defined by means of the <CODE>CALNeighborhood3D</CODE> enum type
 (Listing [lst:CALNeighborhood3D]). Here, we can find the 3D equivalent
 versions of the von Neumann and Moore neighbourhoods, while hexagonal
 neighbourhoods are (obviously) not defined. Custom neighbourhoods will
 be discussed later in Section [sec:CustomNeiughbourhoods]. Similarly,
 the <CODE>CALSpaceBoundaryCondition</CODE> enum type (Listing
 [lst:CALSpaceBoundaryCondition]) allows you to set cyclicality
 condition at boundaries. Eventually, the <CODE>CALOptimization</CODE>
 enum type (Listing [lst:CALOptimization]) allows you to consider the<EM>
 active cells optimization</EM>, discussed later in this Chapter.</P>
<PRE> <CODE> enum CALNeighborhood2D { 
    CAL_CUSTOM_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D,
    CAL_VON_NEUMANN_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D,
    CAL_MOORE_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D,
    CAL_HEXAGONAL_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D,
    CAL_HEXAGONAL_NEIGHBORHOOD_ALT_2D 
};</CODE></PRE>
<PRE> <CODE> enum CALNeighborhood3D {
    CAL_CUSTOM_NEIGHBORHOOD_3D,
    CAL_VON_NEUMANN_NEIGHBORHOOD_3D,
    CAL_MOORE_NEIGHBORHOOD_3D
};</CODE></PRE>
<PRE> <CODE> enum CALSpaceBoundaryCondition{
    CAL_SPACE_FLAT = 0,         
    CAL_SPACE_TOROIDAL
  };</CODE></PRE>
<PRE> <CODE> enum CALOptimization{
    CAL_NO_OPT = 0,
    CAL_OPT_ACTIVE_CELLS        
  };</CODE></PRE>
<P>The CA simulation object is defined at line 30 by the <CODE>
calRunDef2D()</CODE> function. The first parameter is a pointer to a CA
 object (<CODE>life</CODE> in our case), while the second and third
 parameters specify the initial and last simulation step, respectively.
 In this case, we just perform one step of computation, being both the
 first and last step set to 1. The last parameter allows you to specify
 the substate update policy. It can be implicit or explicit (Listing
 [lst:CALUpdateMode]). In the first case, OpenCAL does substates’
 updates for you, while in the second case the substates’ updates is
 your responsibility. Note that, in case implicit update policy is
 applyied, all the CA substates are updated after the execution of each
 elementary process composing the CA transition function. We will
 discuss update policies later in this Chapter. The complete definition
 of <CODE>calRunDef2D()</CODE> is provided in Listing
 [lst:calRunDef2D()]. The <CODE>CALUpdateMode</CODE> type (Listing
 [lst:CALUpdateMode]) enumerates possible update policies.</P>
<PRE> <CODE> struct CALRun2D* calRunDef2D (
    struct CALModel2D* ca2D,
    int initial_step,
    int final_step,
    enum CALUpdateMode UPDATE_MODE
  )	</CODE></PRE>
<PRE> <CODE> enum CALUpdateMode {
    CAL_UPDATE_EXPLICIT = 0,
    CAL_UPDATE_IMPLICIT
  };</CODE></PRE>
<P>Line 33 allocates memory and registers the <CODE>Q</CODE> substate to
 the <CODE>life</CODE> CA, while line 36 adds an elementary process to
 the cell transition function. The <CODE>calAddSubstate2Di()</CODE>
 function is very simple and self-explanatory. At the contrary, <CODE>
calAddElementaryProcess2D()</CODE> must be discussed more in detail. It
 takes the handle to the CA model to which the elementary process must
 be attached and a pointer to a callback function, that defines the
 elementary process itself. In our example, we specified <CODE>
life_transition_function</CODE> as second parameter, being it the name
 of a developer-defined function that you can find at lines 14-24. As
 you can see, the elementary process callback returns <CODE>void</CODE>.
 Moreover, it takes a pointer to a CA object as first parameter,
 followeb by a couple of integers, representing the coordinates of the
 generic cell in the CA space. This is the function prototype which is
 common to each elementary process. Note that, each elementary process
 is applyed by OpenCAL simultaneously to each cell of the cellular space
 in a computational step <A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><SUP>
8</SUP></A>. However, this is completely transparent to the user, so
 that he/she can concentrate his/her effort on the definition of single
 cell behaviour.</P>
<P>When the user is going to implement an elementary process, by
 defining its callback function, he/she can rely on a set of OpenCAL
 functions that allow to get the substates values of both the central
 and the neighbouring cells, and to update the substates values of the
 central cell. In the specific case of the Game of Life, we used the <CODE>
calGet2Di()</CODE> function to get the central cell’s value of the
 substate <CODE>Q</CODE> (remember that the central cell is identified
 by the coordinates (i, j), coming from the callback parameters), the <CODE>
calGetX2Di()</CODE> function to get the value of the n-th neighbour’s
 substate <CODE>Q</CODE>, and the <CODE>calSet2Di()</CODE> function to
 update the value of the substate <CODE>Q</CODE> for the central cell.
 In the Game of Life example, we defined just one elementary process,
 that therefore represents the whole cell transition function. However,
 as we will see later, many elementary processes can be defined in
 OpenCAL by simply calling the <CODE>calAddElementaryProcess2D()</CODE>
 function many times. If you define more than one elementary process,
 they will be executed in the order they are added to the CA.</P>
<P>The <CODE>calInitSubstate2Di()</CODE> function at line 39 sets the
 whole substate <CODE>Q</CODE> to the value 0, i.e. the value of the
 substate <CODE>Q</CODE> is set to 0 in each cell of the cellular space.
 The following lines, from 42 to 46, set the value of the substate <CODE>
Q</CODE> for some cells to 1, in order to define a well known<EM> glider</EM>
 pattern. In this case, we provided the cells coordinates as the third
 and fourth parameters. In this way, we define the initial condition of
 the system direcly inside the <CODE>main</CODE> function. However, as
 we will see later in this Chapter, such kind of initialization can be
 performed by means of a specific function.</P>
<P>The <CODE>calSaveSubstate2Di()</CODE> function (line 49) saves the
 substate <CODE>Q</CODE> to file, while the <CODE>calRun2D()</CODE>
 function (line 52) enters the simulation loop (actually, only one
 computational step in this example), and returns to the <CODE>main</CODE>
 function when the simulation is complete. The <CODE>
calSaveSubstate2Di()</CODE> is thus called again at line 55 to save the
 new (last) configuration of the CA (represented by the only defined
 substate <CODE>Q</CODE>) to file, while the last two functions at lines
 58 and 59 release previously allocated memory. The <CODE>return</CODE>
 statement at line 61 ends our first example.</P>
