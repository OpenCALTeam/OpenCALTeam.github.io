<H2 id="sec:sciddicaT_active"><A NAME="6_5">SciddicaT with active cells
 optimization</A></H2>
<P>Here we present a computationally improved version of SciddicaT,
 which takes advantage of the built-in OpenCAL active cells
 optimization. As stated above, this optimization is able to restrict
 computation to a subset of cells which are actually involved in
 computation, by neglecting those cells for which is sure they will not
 change state to the next step (stationary cells).</P>
<P>In the case of SciddicaT, only cells containing debris and their
 neighbours can change state to the next step, as they can be interested
 in mass variation due to outflows and inflows. At the beginning of the
 simulation, we can simply initialize the set of active cells to those
 cells containing debris (i.e. those cells forming the initial landslide
 source). Moreover, we can add to this set new cells or remove some ones
 from it. Specifically, if an outflow is computed from an active cell
 towards a neighbouring non-active cell, this latter can be added to the
 set of active cells and considered for state change by the remaining
 elementary processes in the current step of computation<A class="footnoteRef"
href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> (if any), or by the next
 computational step. Similarly, if a given active cell looses a
 sufficient amount of debris, it can be eliminated from the set of
 active cells. In the case of SciddicaT, this appens when its thickness
 becomes lower than or equal to a given threshold (i.e.
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(p_\epsilon\)).</P>
<P>In order to account for these processes, we have to slightly revise
 the SciddicaT definition. In particular we have to add the set of
 active cells, A. The optimized SciddicaT model is now defined as</P>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math display&quot;-->
\[SciddicaT = &lt; R, A, X, Q , P, \sigma &gt;\] where
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(A \subseteq R\) is the set of active cells, while the other
 components are defned as before. The transition function is now defined
 as:</P>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math display&quot;-->
\[\sigma : A \times Q^5 \shortrightarrow Q \times A\] denoting that it
 is applied to only the cells in
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(A\) and that it can add/remove active cells. More in detail, the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_1\) elementary process has to be modified, as it can activate
 new cell. Moreover, a new elementary process,
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_3\), has to be added in order to remove cells that cannot
 produce outflows during the next computational step due to the fact
 that their debris thickness is negligible. The new sequence of
 elementary processes is listed below, in the same order they are
 applied.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
\(\sigma_1 : A \times (Q_z \times Q_h)^5 \times p_\epsilon \times p_r
 \shortrightarrow Q_o^4 \times A\) determines the outflows from the
 central cell to the neighboring ones, as before. In addition, each time
 an outflow is computed, the neighbour receiving the flow is added to
 the set of active cells.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
\(\sigma_2: A \times Q_h \times (Q_o^4)^4 \shortrightarrow Q_h\)
 determines the value of debris thickness inside the cell by considering
 mass exchange in the cell neighborhood. This elementary process does
 not change with respect to the original version of SciddicaT.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
\(\sigma_3: A \times Q_h \times p_\epsilon \shortrightarrow A\) removes
 a cell from
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(A\) if its debris thickness is lower than or equal to the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(p_\epsilon\) threshold.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>In order to implement the SciddicaT debris flows model in OpenCAL by
 exploiting the active cells optimization, we have to chage the
 definition of the CA objet, by also adding the third
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_3\) elementary process. Moreover, the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_1\) elementary process has to be changed. A complete
 implementation of the sactive cells optimized version of SciddicaT is
 shown in Listing [lst:cal_Sciddicat-activecells] for the sake of
 completeness, even if only the differences with respect to the original
 implementation are commented.</P>
<P>As you can easily see, few modifications to the original source code
 are needed to add the active cells optimization to SciddicaT. In
 particular, the active cells optimization is enabled by means of the <CODE>
CAL_OPT_ACTIVE_CELLS</CODE> parameter at line 159, while the third
 elementary process added at line 165. As regards the elementary
 processe
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_1\), it is the same of the one of the basic SciddicaT version,
 with the exception that when an outflow is generated, the cell
 receiving the flow is added to the set A of the active cells (line 88).
 Moreover, an active cell is eliminated by the set A by means of the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\sigma_3\) elementary process in the case its debris thickness
 becomes lower than or equal to the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(p_\epsilon\) threshold parameter (lines 107-108).</P>
<P>Regarding the computational preformace, the same simulation shown in
 Figure [fig:sciddicaT] was executed using the new SciddicaT
 implementation adopting the active cells implementation. Still, only a
 single core of the Intel Core i7-4702HQ CPU was used, as we did before.
 The simulation lasted a total of 22 seconds, versus 172 seconds
 obtained for the basic (non-optimized) version, which is about 8 times
 faster. This can be condidered a very good result you can easily obtain
 when your simulation involves only a limited subset of the
 computational domain.</P>
