 Applications of Cellular Automata</A></H2>
<P>CA are particularly suited to model and simulate classes of complex
 systems characterized by a large number of interacting elementary
 components. The assumption that if a system behaviour is complex, the
 model that describes it must necessarily be of the same complexity is
 replaced by the idea that its behavior can be described, at least in
 some cases, in very simple terms.</P>
<P>Among different fields, fluid-dynamics is one of most important
 applications for CA and, in this research branch, many different
 CA-based methods can be found in the literature to simulate fluid
 flows. For instance, Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) were introduced for
 describing the motion and collision of<EM> particles</EM> on a grid and
 it was shown that such models can reproduce the main fluid dynamical
 properties. The continuum limit of these models leads to the
 Navier-Stokes equations. Lattice Gas models can be regarded as
 microscopic models, as they describe the motion of fluid particles
 which interact by scattering. An advantage of Lattice Gas models is
 that the simplicity of particles, and of their interactions, allow for
 the simulation of a large number of them, making it therefore possible
 to observe the emergence of flow patterns. Furthermore, since they are
 CA systems, it is possible to easily run simulations in parallel. A
 different approach to LGA is represented by Lattice Boltzmann models in
 which the state variables can take continuous values, as they are
 supposed to represent the density of fluid particles, endowed with
 certain properties, located in each cell (space and time are also
 discrete, as in lattice gas models). Both Lattice Gas and Lattice
 Boltzmann Models have been applied for the description of fluid
 turbulence.</P>
<P>Since many complex natural phenomena evolve on very large areas, they
 are therefore difficult to be modelled at a microscopic level of
 description. Among these, we can find some real flow-type phenomena
 like debris and lava flows, as well as floods and pyroclastic flows.
 Besides rheological complex behaviour, they generally evolve on complex
 topographies, that can even change during the phenomenon evolution, and
 are often characterised by branching and rejoining of the flow. In
 order to better model such kind of phenomena, an extended notion of
 Cellular Automata (eXtended Cellular Automata, described in the next
 Section), can represent a valid alternative to classical CA.</P>
